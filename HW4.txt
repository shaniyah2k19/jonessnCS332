How to Compile
Using a Makefile
1. Make sure the MakeFile is in the project direcory with the following.
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -pthread -Wall -Wextra

all: process_threads

process_threads: jonessn_HW04.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o process_threads jonessn_HW04.c
clean:
	rm -f process_threads
2. Compile the program by running   'make'.
3. The process_threads will be created in the direcotry.

Without a Makefile:
- If you prefer not to use a Makefile
1. Run this command       
 gcc -o jonessn_HW04 jonessn_HW04.c -pthread 
This command will produce the process_threads.
After complilation use the command           ./process_threads
